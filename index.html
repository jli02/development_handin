          Many websites have a favoriting option and aggregators. But not all of
          them implement them the same way. I did a competitive analysis to look
          at the design choices of three sites and to inform my the
          implementation of my own app for creating a list of items to pack.

          I looked at three clothing sites - ThredUp, Uniqlo, and Princess Polly
          - to see how they implemented their favoriting features. Here's a
          chart of some features across the sites.

        <p class="section-text">
          I like how the Uniqlo and Princess Polly sites show how many items are
          favorited, designated by a number that is in the corner with a heart.
          It reminds the user how many items they may want to take a second look
          at, and it may encourage the user to revisit their favorites and buy
          them. Another feature I liked was being able to see which items have
          already been added. ThredUp and Princess Polly have a heart on each
          item, which is filled when it is favorited. For Uniqlo, each item also
          has a heart, but this heart is not filled in if the item is favorited,
          which may confuse the user. From a design perspective, the use of
          color makes it more clear which items have already been added and
          overall makes the favoriting option less confusing.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          One feature that I did not think was effective was requiring the user
          to make an account in order to add favorites. ThredUp and Uniqlo
          wanted me to make an account in order to favorite items, and though
          this may be beneficial for getting more people to make accounts, I
          felt like this feature made me want to leave the site instead because
          it was just another additional step I had to take towards my intended
          goal.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          In my own implementaion, I want the user to be able to see the total
          number of items favorited since I found this feature effective. For my
          app in particular, it would be helpful to see how many items a person
          still has left to pack. I also would want the option to clear the
          aggregator. For all three of the sites, I had to remove items
          individually if I no longer wanted them in my favorites, which could
          get tedious if I favorited a lot of items. Thus, it would be more
          convenient to have the option of clearing a list completely. These are
          features that I implement in my own app, which you can read about
          below!

        <p class="section-text">
          As someone who always makes lists for everything, I thought it would
          be useful to have a tool for planning "to-pack" lists. The app allows
          the user to filter by types of items, such as clothing and toiletries,
          and by degree of importance. There is also a sorting feature to sort
          by alphabetical order to make it easier to find items to add. On the
          right side of the app, there is an aggregator that totals up number of
          items added, which could gives the user an idea of how much they still
          have to pack. Users can also remove items from the aggregator once
          they have packed the corresponding items.

        <h1 class="section-header">IV. Takeaways</h1>
        <p class="section-text">
          I wish I implemented the remove item feature through an "X" instead of
          a button, which takes up more space and looks clunky. I was a little
          low on time, but I would definitely revisit this project and see how I
          can continue to improve my design.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          It was helpful to take inspiration from the different sites, and
          competitive analysis was a very effective tool in comparing their
          differences. This was good practice in seeing what design choices were
          effective and to take inspiration for my own implementations!
